DaisyChain
----------

**DaisyChain** is a micro framework which makes UIView animations chaining dead simple. It uses the exact same interface you are familiars with.

#### Chaining made simple
We all have seen or written code which looks like this:

```swift
UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.5, animations: {
    view.center = CGPoint(x: 0.0, y: 0.0)
}, completion: { _ in
    UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.5, animations: {
        view.center = CGPoint(x: 100.0, y: 0.0)
    }, completion: { _ in
        UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.5, animations: {
            view.center = CGPoint(x: 100.0, y: 100.0)
        }, completion: { _ in
            UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.5, animations: {
                view.center = CGPoint(x: 0.0, y: 100.0)
            }, completion: { _ in
                UIView.animate(0.5, animations: {
                    view.center = CGPoint(x: 0.0, y: 0.0)
                })
            })
        })
    })
})
```

This can go pretty far, it is also know as the *callback hell*. It's not very flexible and hard to read.

With **DaisyChain** the above code looks like this:

```swift
let chain = DaisyChain()

chain.animate(withDuration: 0.5, animations: {
    view.center = CGPoint(x: 0.0, y: 0.0)
})

chain.animate(withDuration: 0.5, animations: {
    view.center = CGPoint(x: 100.0, y: 0.0)
})

chain.animate(withDuration: 0.5, animations: {
    view.center = CGPoint(x: 100.0, y: 100.0)
})

chain.animate(withDuration: 0.5, animations: {
    view.center = CGPoint(x: 0.0, y: 100.0)
})

chain.animate(withDuration: 0.5, animations: {
    view.center = CGPoint(x: 0.0, y: 0.0)
})
```

As you can the the code looks more flat, it allows you to easy modify orders or add new steps.

#### Breakable chains

**DaisyChain** also adds a simple way to break animation sequences, simply set the `broken` property to `yes` to break a chain:
```swift
chain.broken = true
```

To continue chaining animation, you'll need to put it back to `false` or create a new chain.

#### Setting up with CocoaPods

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'DaisyChain', '~> 1.0.0'
```

#### Setting up with Carthage

```ogdl
github "alikaragoz/DaisyChain" ~> 1.0.0
```
